#  RegistrationUser task

This is an app with 3-screen registration ui and server api. On first screen you can create user by providing email and password. After that server api sends confirmation code to provided email and ui moves you to second screen, waiting for email confirmation. When mail confirmed, user gets random name and photo from random user api (this is a tech viewer req) and see hello screen (third screen of registration).
